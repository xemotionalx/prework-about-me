      <h1>how my dream to become a web developer began...</h1>
      <p>when i was a kid i taught myself HTML and CSS so that i could have the
        flyest neopet pet pages & myspace profile. i never had the attention span for homework, but i could spend hours 
        reading and editing code (my parents were obviously not so stoked about this).
      </p>
      <p>
        in retrospect it was pretty ignorant that when i decided on my major in 
        college i didn't even consider computer science because 'i'm not a math person'. 
      </p>
      <p>
        fast forward through the montage of my young adult years to now...  
        i'd been working as classroom teacher for 5 years, but i'd grown out of it.  
        i was grateful for the experience, but with no opportunities for advancement in 
        my career path, it was time to move on.  
      </p>
      <p>
        as i considered my options, i realized i could turn my old hobby into a viable skillset and enter a profession 
        with abundant opportunities for creativity, growth, collaboration and advancement. 
      </p>
      <p>
        so hi, here i am! ready to do this thing!
