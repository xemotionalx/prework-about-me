      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>I'm a Ravenclaw.</p>
      <p>If I had my own Pokemon gym it would be fairy type.</p>
      <p>I've been a middle school teacher for the past 5 years but I'm looking forward
        to changing my title to "web developer"</p>

      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>Making educational videogames fun enough to trick 
        middle schoolers into enjoying learning.</p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>Fishtown, Philly</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>When I was a kid I taught myself HTML and CSS so that I could have the
        flyest Neopet pet pages and myspace profile. I've always loved the challenge
        of coding and I want to take my skillset to the next level because there are so 
        many opportunities in every field for this skillset. I'd like to work for a curriculum
         company an combine my expertise as a classroom teacher with my skills as a web developer.
